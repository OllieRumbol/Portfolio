    The first thing that comes to mind when describing Ollie is his
    passion. He really cares about what he is working on and will
    always fight to make his projects as good as they possibly can
    be. Ollie has a great understanding of C# & .Net, as well as
    amazing frontend skills, especially in vue.js.

    Ollie is hardworking, loyal, highly intelligence but also very
    humble, he will always be the first to admit when he is wrong.
    His communication skills are top notch and he makes friends with
    everyone he meets.
