    React is a simple but powerful JS library used to create single-page web applications. React is built by Facebook
    and
    full documentation can be found <a href='https://reactjs.org/'>here</a>. The React library provides a whole host of
    useful tools. Tools include but not limited to JSX, virtual DOM, one-way binding, state management and component
    design.
</p>
<p>
    This article illustrates some basic steps developers new to react can take to ensure their React project has a solid
    base for future development. I will show how the React app can be deployed using GitHub pages as well as some other
    useful tools. Before starting anything its a good idea to create a GitHub repo and clone it locally
</p>
<h3>1. Dependencies</h3>
<p>
    There is a great tool for starting a new react project and is actually recommend by Facebook themselves. Its called 
    create-react-app and a link to docs can be found
    <a href='https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app'>here</a>. A simple 
    <code>npx create-react-app <i>project name</i></code> is all it takes to create a new project. Then a <code>npm start</code>
    wil run your project in node.
</p>
<h3>2. Refactor</h3>
<p>
    The create-react-app is a great tool and installs all the dependencies you need to start a project. However it does
    create a lot of assets that you don't need and doesn't create the clearest project structure, especially in the src
    folder. Before the project goes any further its good idea to take sometime and delete all unwanted files and restructure 
    the src folder. I like to add the following folders in the src folder to create a very clear structure.
    <ul>
        <li><span>components</span></li>
        <li><span>style</span></li>
        <li><span>assets</span></li>
        <li><span>tests</span></li>
        <li><span>hocks (optional)</span></li>
        <li><span>store (optional)</span></li>
        <li><span>backend (optional)</span></li>
    </ul> 
</p>
<h3>3. Routing</h3>
<p>
    Its at this point in your project you want to starting thinking abut routing. This is because its easier to do it
    now than later on in your project when you have your components are already laid out and to make changes would
    involve pushing them further down in your tree.
</p>
<p>
    I like to add routing at the highest component in the tree. React has a good package called react-router-dom
    that can help you do this. Below is a small guide to help to get started.
</p>
<ol>
    <li><span>Install package</span></li>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <code>
                npm install react react-dom
            </code>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <li><span>Add imports</span></li>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <code>
                import { HashRouter as Router, Route, Switch, Link } from 'react-router-dom';
            </code>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <li><span>Add Router tags which will contain both 'Link' and 'Route' tags</span></li>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <code>
                &lt;Router&gt;
                <br />
                ...
                <br />
                &lt;/Router&gt;
            </code>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <li><span>Add link elements with a 'to' attribute</span></li>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <code>
                &lt;Link to='/..'&gt;...&lt;Link&gt;
            </code>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <li>
        <span>
            Add routes with 'path' and 'component' attributes. Notice the 'to' and 'path' attributes will match thus
            loading that component on the page. All routes are contained in switch tags.
        </span>
    </li>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <code>
                &lt;Switch&gt;
                <br />
                    &lt;Route path="/..." exact component={() => ...} /&gt;
                <br />
                &lt;/Switch&gt;
            </code>
        </li>
    </ul>
</ol>
<h3>4. Hosting</h3>
<p>
    Hosting makes a big difference to a project and there a variety of ways to do it. Github provides a free hosting
    services for static pages call 'GitHub Pages'.
</p>
<h3>5. CI/CD</h3>
<p>
    In all my experience as a developer creating a CI/CD pipeline is by far the most useful code I have ever written.
