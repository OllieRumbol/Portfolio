    Software engineering is now a part of many companies, not just tech companies. Companies such as finance, insurance,
    logistics, retail, and so much more. Thus meaning its more common to see companies having software engineering departments 
    either for internal tools or as actually products.

<p>
    However regardless of what the company does one shared problem that can occur is the idea of technical debt. In this 
    article I want to have a more open and honest conversation about it. What it is, how it affects companies, impact it has, when is it 
    a problem, what to do about, etc.  
</p>
<h3>What is technical debt</h3>
<p>
    Technical debt is where over time technical solutions start to age and begin to root. Means these solutions becoming harder to manage in
    terms of adding news features or fixing bugs, harder to integrate with other products or replace the solution entirely due to dependencies, 
    and becomes harder for new developers to learn. 
</p>
<h3>Why does technical debt occur</h3>
<p>
    This huge issue occurs for a number of reasons. 
    <ul>
        <li>
            <span>
                Using old tools and libraries
            </span>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span>
                Poor coding standards
            </span>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span>
                Strict deadlines resulting in rushed solutions
            </span>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span>
                Lack of well defined requirements 
            </span>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span>
                Lots on undefined external dependencies
            </span>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span>
                Lack of knowledge in the business combined with the lack of training and documentation
            </span>
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h3>How does it impact the company and its employees</h3>
<p>

</p>
<h3>When does it becoming a problem</h3>
<p>

</p>
<h3>Now for the honest bit</h3>
<p>
    Nothing in the above article is ground breaking, the knowledge and ideas have been around for decades. So why then in 2021 with all the 
    technological advances humans have made does the topic and problem of technical debt never seem to go away. Now there are a few reasons 
    for this, most of which are due to limitations. Limitations in technological, limitations in time, limitations in resource and 
    limitations in knowledge.
</p>
<p>
    However there is a cause of technical debt that people don't talk about, ego. I believe developers at all levels can have their own ego
    wrapped up in their own code. This results in clearly failed projects being branded as good ideas and never being fixed. But its far 
    worse than that, it means those failed standards persist and grow in the company at all levels and affect future projects. This 
    results in fixing technical debt a very difficult task.
</p>
<p>
    Well thats the problem, now time for the solution.
