    Oli, is one of the most passionate team leads I have worked
    with. He always finds away to increase morale and include
    everybody in activities, he will always try his up most to
    ensure his team are happy and improve processes for a better
    developer experience. Oli will also go above and beyond for his
    team and as well the business, which shows his level of
    dedication. He is also a positive role model and mentor to more
    junior members of the team ensuring that they are looked after
    and providing an environment and platform for more junior
    members to ask questions, an example of this was when he came up
    with the initiative to have a bi-weekly technical round table
    for the team to ensure more junior members have better access to
    learning from more senior members of the team.

    Oli is confident and has the ability to communicate with a range
    of stakeholders on technical subjects and also on non-technical
    subjects and has sound knowledge of the software development
    lifecycle and agile methodologies.

<p class="fs-4">
    His passion for tech shows through especially with the
    development of his JWT Validator nuget package, of which is a
    product of his own which he has grown. He also takes it upon
    himself to better his skill set outside working hours to enhance
    his knowledge around the .NET ecosystem as well as front-end
    development with react.

    I would recommend Oli as a top asset for any team!
