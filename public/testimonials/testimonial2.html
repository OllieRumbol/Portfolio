    Oliver is one of the most passionate team leads I’ve come across
    in my years within the industry. He’s extremely hard working,
    always striving for the best, wether that’s for himself or for
    his team.{" "}
</p>
<p class="fs-4">
    One of his biggest assets to any team is his selfless manner, he
    will always help those who are in need, wether that is a member
    of his team or someone else within the company. I’ve not come
    across someone who has always had a focus on his teams
    well-being and tried to always be that cornerstone for his team
    to come to when needed.{" "}

<p class="fs-4">
    Over my brief time getting to know Oliver and working with him,
    he’s always offered support in anyway he can and if he was
    unable to resolve my issues, he would go out of his way to
    discuss with those who could on my behalf.{" "}

<p class="fs-4">
    Oliver will be a great asset to any team, in whatever role he is
    put into.
