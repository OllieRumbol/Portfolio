<p>
    Software engineering is now a part of many companies, not just tech companies. Companies such as finance, insurance,
    logistics, retail, and so much more. This meaning it's more common to see companies having software engineering
    departments either for internal tools or as actual products.
</p>
<p>
    However, regardless of what the company does one shared problem that can occur is the idea of technical debt. In
    this article, I want to have a more open and honest conversation about it. What it is, how it affects companies, the
    impact it has, when is it a problem, what to do about it, etc.
</p>
<h3>What is technical debt</h3>
<p>
    Technical debt is where over time technical solutions start to age and begin to root. This means these solutions
    becoming
    harder to manage in
    terms of adding new features or fixing bugs, harder to integrate with other products or replace the solution
    entirely due to dependencies,
    and becomes harder for new developers to learn.
</p>
<h3>Why does technical debt occur</h3>
<p>
    This huge issue occurs for a number of reasons.
<ul>
    <li>
        <span>
            Using old tools and libraries
        </span>
    </li>
    <li>
        <span>
            Poor coding standards
        </span>
    </li>
    <li>
        <span>
            Strict deadlines resulting in rushed solutions
        </span>
    </li>
    <li>
        <span>
            Lack of well defined requirements
        </span>
    </li>
    <li>
        <span>
            Lots on undefined external dependencies
        </span>
    </li>
    <li>
        <span>
            Lack of knowledge in the business combined with the lack of training and documentation
        </span>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>Impact of technical debt</h3>
<p>
    Technical debt has no positive impact to any part of a company. This problem impacts
<ul>
    <li>
        <span>
            Employees
        </span>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <span>
                    Working with old and broken solutions can have serious mental impacts on the employees of the
                    company. Sadly there are several reasons for this.
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <span>
                                Simple bugs take a long time to debug and fix
                            </span>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span>
                                Adding features is just impossible
                            </span>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span>
                                Testing is never an easy task. This lack of clarity leads to many attempts to fix a
                                problem
                            </span>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span>
                                Developers are not improving their skill sets and learning new tools and process. They
                                are just
                                employed to keep the old stuff working
                            </span>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </span>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <span>
            Customers
        </span>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <span>
                    Any request for changes the client makes just takes forever and is never an easy task. This adds a
                    lot of stress for
                    all parties involved
                </span>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <span>
            Business progress
        </span>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <span>
                    Overtime this impact is huge and really grinds progress to a halt or just creates more technical
                    debt. All problems just result in everything just taking longer to complete.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <span>
                                Increase in support work, takes developers away from projects
                            </span>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span>
                                New work involving old infrastructure is just a nightmare to complete
                            </span>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span>
                                Poor standards infect and delay new projects
                            </span>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span>
                                Not enough time to scope new work or even gather requirements
                            </span>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span>
                                Never any time to look at new technologies to improve company infrastructure
                            </span>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </span>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>

</ul>

<h3>When does it becoming a problem</h3>
<p>
    In my opinion technical debt is always something to consider in a project even if it's new. This is because
    technical debt will naturally occur due to the fact technically is always progressing with new tools, libraries and
    design patterns. Also, hindsight is a very powerful thing and it's far easier to see a better solution once finished
    than at the start of the project.
</p>
<p>
    Another easy way to know if your company has a problem with technical debt is to simply talk to the developers.
    Developers work
    with these solutions, day in and day out and know all the problems they face,
</p>
<h3>Now for the honest bit</h3>
<p>
    Nothing in the above article is groundbreaking, the knowledge and ideas have been around for decades. So why then in
    2021 with all the technological advances humans have made does the topic and problem of technical debt never seem to
    go away. Now there are a few reasons for this, most of which are due to limitations. Limitations in technological,
    limitations in time, limitations in
    resource and
    limitations in knowledge.
</p>
<p>
    However, there is a cause of technical debt that people don't talk about, ego. I believe developers at all levels
    can have their own ego wrapped up in their own code. This results in clearly failed projects being branded as good 
    ideas. But it's far worse than that, it means those failed standards persist and grow in the company at all levels
    and affect future projects, infrastructure and management. This results in fixing technical debt a very difficult 
    task.
</p>
<h3>How do we fix it</h3>
<p>
    To stop the serious impact of technical debt, the company needs to put value into fixing it and not just putting value 
    into new solutions. This might mean for a year don't add any new business and spend the year improving the infrastructure.
    We need to start coding things once in a generic solution instead of building lots one of custom solutions (in the long 
    run this will save time). We need to start embracing new ideas and stops doing things because thats how we have always 
    done them in the past. Developers need sufficient time to actually build solutions properly. All companies should have 
    coding guidelines, code reviews and automated testing to make sure developers are living up to the correct standards.
    Allow time for developers to up skill themselves and actually use those skills (would provide a huge motivation). 
    The above ideas are not rocket science, infact many of these ideas are good software development practices. But actually
    doing these things in the hard part because people are set in their ways and other external factors like profit get in the 
    way.
