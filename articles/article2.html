    Software engineering is now a part of many companies, not just tech companies. Companies such as finance, insurance,
    logistics, retail, and so much more. Thus meaning its more common to see companies having software engineering departments 
    either for internal tools or as actually products.

<p>
    However regardless of what the company does one shared problem that can occur is the idea of technical debt. In this 
    article I want to have a more open and honest conversation about it. What it is, how it affects companies, impact it has, when is it 
    a problem, what to do about, etc.  
</p>
<h3>What</h3>
<p>
    Technical debt is where over time technical solutions start to age and begin to root. Means these solutions becoming harder to manage in
    terms of adding news features or fixing bugs, harder to integrate with other products or replace the solution entirely due to dependencies, 
    and becomes harder for new developers to learn. 
</p>
<h3>Why</h3>
<p>
    This huge issue occurs for a number of reasons. 
    <ul>
        <li>
            <span>
                Using old tools and libraries
            </span>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span>
                Poor coding standards
            </span>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span>
                Strict deadlines resulting in rushed solutions
            </span>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span>
                Lack of well defined requirements 
            </span>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span>
                Lots on undefined external dependencies
            </span>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span>
                Lack of knowledge in the business combined with the lack of training and documentation
            </span>
        </li>
    </ul>
