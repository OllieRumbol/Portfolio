<p>
    Software engineering is now a part of many companies, not just tech companies. Companies such as finance, insurance,
    logistics, retail, and so much more. Thus meaning its more common to see companies having software engineering
    departments
    either for internal tools or as actually products.
</p>
<p>
    However regardless of what the company does one shared problem that can occur is the idea of technical debt. In this
    article I want to have a more open and honest conversation about it. What it is, how it affects companies, impact it
    has, when is it
    a problem, what to do about, etc.
</p>
<h3>What is technical debt</h3>
<p>
    Technical debt is where over time technical solutions start to age and begin to root. Means these solutions becoming
    harder to manage in
    terms of adding news features or fixing bugs, harder to integrate with other products or replace the solution
    entirely due to dependencies,
    and becomes harder for new developers to learn.
</p>
<h3>Why does technical debt occur</h3>
<p>
    This huge issue occurs for a number of reasons.
<ul>
    <li>
        <span>
            Using old tools and libraries
        </span>
    </li>
    <li>
        <span>
            Poor coding standards
        </span>
    </li>
    <li>
        <span>
            Strict deadlines resulting in rushed solutions
        </span>
    </li>
    <li>
        <span>
            Lack of well defined requirements
        </span>
    </li>
    <li>
        <span>
            Lots on undefined external dependencies
        </span>
    </li>
    <li>
        <span>
            Lack of knowledge in the business combined with the lack of training and documentation
        </span>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>Impact of technical debt</h3>
<p>
    Technical debt has no positive impact to any part of a company. This problem impacts
<ul>
    <li>
        <span>
            Employees
        </span>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <span>
                    Working with old and broken solutions can have a serious mental impacts to the employees of the
                    company. Sadly there are several reason for this.
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <span>
                                Simple bugs take a long time to debug and fix
                            </span>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span>
                                Adding features is just impossible
                            </span>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span>
                                Testing is never an easy task. This lack of clarity leads to many attempts to fix a
                                problem
                            </span>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span>
                                Developers are not improving their skill sets and learning new tools and process. They
                                are just
                                employed to keep the old stuff working
                            </span>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </span>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <span>
            Customers
        </span>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <span>
                    Any request for changes the client makes just takes forever and is never an easy task. This adds a
                    lot of stress for
                    all parties involved
                </span>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <span>
            Business progress
        </span>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <span>
                    Overtime this impact is huge and really grinds progress to a halt or just creates more technical
                    debt. All problems just result in everything just taking longer to complete. 
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <span>
                                Increase in support work, takes developers away from projects
                            </span>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span>
                                New work involving old infrastructure is just a nightmare to complete
                            </span>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span>
                                Poor standards infect and delay new projects
                            </span>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span>
                                Not enough time to scope new work or even gather requirements
                            </span>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span>
                                Never any time to look at new technologies to improve company infrastructure 
                            </span>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </span>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>

</ul>
</p>
<h3>When does it becoming a problem</h3>
<p>
    In my opinion technical debt is always a problem and should always be consider, even at the start of the project.
</p>
<h3>Now for the honest bit</h3>
<p>
    Nothing in the above article is ground breaking, the knowledge and ideas have been around for decades. So why then
    in 2021 with all the
    technological advances humans have made does the topic and problem of technical debt never seem to go away. Now
    there are a few reasons
    for this, most of which are due to limitations. Limitations in technological, limitations in time, limitations in
    resource and
    limitations in knowledge.
</p>
<p>
    However there is a cause of technical debt that people don't talk about, ego. I believe developers at all levels can
    have their own ego
    wrapped up in their own code. This results in clearly failed projects being branded as good ideas and never being
    fixed. But its far
    worse than that, it means those failed standards persist and grow in the company at all levels and affect future
    projects. This
    results in fixing technical debt a very difficult task.
</p>
<p>
    Well thats the problem, now time for the solution.
